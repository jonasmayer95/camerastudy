Alright, since clrzmq hasn't been updated since 2012, I've decided to replace it with NetMQ,
which is a straight C# port of libzmq. It contains a .NET 3.5 project that we can use within
Unity, although there are some things you have to do to get it working properly.

Note that there are NuGet packages of the libraries as well, but I haven't tested those, because
I'm lazy and I was already building from source. The DLLs will probably end up being pushed into
the repo anyway, but I'm not going to do it right away (and maybe search for a better solution
instead of storing binary files in *source* control).
Anyway, here's the build instructions:

1. clone the latest NetMQ master (da8f4a657f7ec78af1b00ed12d8bdd9a632224ac as of now)
   from https://github.com/zeromq/netmq.git
2. build the NetMQ3.5 project and copy NetMQ.dll into our Assets folder
3. clone the latest AsyncIO master (4634efa5c1fd6fd01b95810294ebd24e9b8cf170 as of now)
   from https://github.com/somdoron/AsyncIO.git
4. build the AsyncIO.Unity project and copy its output into our Assets folder
5. start Unity and click play to confirm it works
6. stare at all the wonderful log messages
7. read the code, as it contains some comments
8. if you make changes, do NOT push the netmq and asyncio DLLs yet; I'll take care of that.
