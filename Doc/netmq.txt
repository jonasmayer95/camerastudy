Here's a link to my (hacked together) sample of a zmq publisher:
http://1drv.ms/1H7dyMw

It sends a message with some json from the spec, sleeps for
one second and does the same thing all over again. NetMQ does
not have problems connecting, since the publisher does not use
any security features whatsoever.

If you want to test it,
download and extract the .zip, compile it with MSVC (don't
forget to switch to x64 if it is not set) and start it. The server
is set up on the loopback address 127.0.0.1:8888; the latest client
version features a basic connection UI, so just type that in and
leave the topic field empty.
